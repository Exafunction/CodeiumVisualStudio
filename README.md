# Windsurf for Visual Studio

[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) is the modern coding superpower, a free code acceleration toolkit built on cutting edge AI technology. Currently, Windsurf provides autocomplete, chat, and search capabilities in 70+ languages, with lightning fast speeds and state-of-the-art suggestion quality.

There are many parts of the modern coding workflow that are boring, tedious, or frustrating, from regurgitating boilerplate to poring through StackOverflow. Recent advances in AI allow us to eliminate these parts, making it seamless to turn your ideas into code. With easy integration into Visual Studio and a less than 2 minute installation process, you can focus on being the best software developer, not the best code monkey.

With Windsurf, you get:
- Unlimited single and multi-line code completions forever.
- IDE-integrated chat: no need to leave Visual Studio to ChatGPT, and use convenient suggestions such as [Refactor](#refactor) and [Explain](#explain).
- Support for 70+ programming languages: Javascript, Python, Typescript, PHP, Go, Java, C, C++, Rust, Ruby, and more.
- Support through our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/3XFf78nAx5).

Join thousands of other developers who are using Windsurf for free to accelerate their software iteration process, improve their code quality and consistency, reduce the number of code review iterations, accelerate developer onboarding, and keep them in their flow state.
